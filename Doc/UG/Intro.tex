\section{Introduction}

Welcome to \ffrLFDFT documentation.
In this document you will find the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item basic information about \ffrLFDFT
\item how to compile and use the program
\item implementation details of the program
\end{itemize}

{\tt ffr-LFDFT} is a poor man's program (or collection of subroutines, as of now)
to carry out electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory
and Lagrange basis set.

This program is intended for research in implementation of new methods in
electronic structure calculations in condensed matter.
Currently it is not as stable or have lot of functionalities
as more well-known package such as Quantum Espresso, ABINIT, or VASP.
However, it can be used to calculate total energy of solids.

This program is written mainly by Fadjar Fathurrahman at Research Center
of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia.

% Add tutorial on how to use m\_LF3d module to solve Schrodinger equation
% in 1d.
% In LF3d periodic, only gamma-point sampling is used.
